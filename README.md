## Power BI Custom Visual Tachometer

Fork: https://github.com/EarnestAssoc/powerbi-visuals-eatachometer

This fork has been created to introduce dynamic axis labels positioned adjacent to the range's beginning. Notably, it supports both percentile and numerical axis labels for greater versatility. I believe this enhancement offers a more intuitive visual representation for data-driven insights. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!

You can further customize this as per your project specifics or repository guidelines.


The original project:

The Tachometer is a flexible gauge that allows you to quickly convey detailed information in a way that can be intuitively understood.  Many customizable features are included to configure the look and feel as well as behavior, for example, variable start and end angles, configurable orientation, colors, labels, and axis scale.  This is an ideal visual for communicating measures against low, acceptable, and high components such as team performance against targets, error rates, test coverage, and customer satisfaction. 

See (https://github.com/ChamaraIC/Tachometer "Original Tachometer on GitHub") for detailed information about the capabilities of this visual.
